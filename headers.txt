Headers and Descriptions by Luis Otero and Jorge Aguniga

Location header: The location response header is used to redirect the client to a different URL rather than the URL that the 
client requested. Location header is used with response 201 (CREATED) to redirect the client to new resources. This header is 
used for 3xx responses for when the server wants to redirect the client to the server’s preferred URL for automatic redirection 
for the sources.

P3P Header: P3P stands for The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project which enabled websites to express their privacy practices. 
P3P user agents were allowed to be informed about the sites practices using this header and to automate any decision making based on 
the site’s practices. With this header, the users did not have to read the privacy policies of each site they visited. The organization 
in charge of P3P stopped working and supporting the project since many modern browsers did not support P3P. Many sites like Facebook and 
Google still have the P3P header but no longer use it instead the P3P header contains a link to the sites corresponding page about why 
they don't support P3P anymore.

Cache-control: The Cache-control header specifies directives for caching requests and responses. The directives for the requests do 
not have to be the same as the ones for the response. Client directives include max-age=<seconds>, no-cache, no-store, no-transform, and 
so on. Server directives include some of the ones like the client such as no-cache, no-store, and no-transform but also ones that the 
client does not have such as public, private, and proxy-revalidate.

X-XSS-Protection: This header is only available to use with Safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer. This header is used to make pages stop 
loading when a reflected cross-site scripting attack is detected on the page. The header is used mainly for old web browsers that don’t 
support content-support-policy for disallowing in-line javascript.
